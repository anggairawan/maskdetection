# Mask Detection Mobile App
This repository contains documents about machine learning implementation and model deployment as a final project of <a href='https://events.withgoogle.com/bangkit/'>Bangk!t Academy</a> contributed by

In this problem we work on binary classification case to classify image dataset into 'mask' or 'no-mask' class using deep learning.

### Dataset
We use [Mask Datasets V1](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmetfurkandemr/mask-datasets-v1/) contain datasets as follow


### Model Building

* [Improved model using like MobileNetV2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eslkolHfvmGBPteIXxl4_1BCPYx67nJx?usp=sharing)
* [Improved model using transfer learning (MobileNetV2)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eslkolHfvmGBPteIXxl4_1BCPYx67nJx?usp=sharing)

### Demonstration
This app demonstrates how to build machine learning application on mobile device by utilising tflite model embedded in apk. 
The app is adapted from [this project](https://github.com/esafirm/bangkit-image-classifier-example).

The tflite model and label can be obtained by running this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eslkolHfvmGBPteIXxl4_1BCPYx67nJx?usp=sharing)
